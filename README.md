The Cyclops Simulator â€“ proposal 

Game basis: 

The basis for the game will be a simple wave shooter app that will be modified to be more compatible with mobile devices and uses the google cardboard headset. 

I have chosen mobile devices as they are easily available to a large portion of people and are provide cheap and easy to use experiences within Virtual and Augmented reality.  

The game will consist of a single round where the player will be able to shoot a laser from their head. This laser will be able to hit and stop/destroy enemies. Destroying enemies will add to the players score. The enemies will go toward the player and if they get too close will deal damage. If the player takes too much damage the round will be over and the players score will be displayed.  

There are many constraints to using mobile platform. When using a mobile headset, you are unable to interact with the physical phone which limits the amount of interactivity for the player. One way around this would be to create a physical button which extends beyond the headset that the player can interact with. Or to use other ways of interacting with the phone such as through sound. 

My plan is to have the laser be activated through the click of a button which will be attached through the headphone/audio jack of the phone.  

Research of the market: 

Currently the augmented reality market for android contains mostly games which do not require the use of the google cardboard headset. Most of the apps available use general clicking interfaces similar to that of most game apps for android phones, except the display camera input to the screen. 

Examples of this is droid shooter(1) and Zombie Go(2). The first is an app where droids spawn around you and are able to shoot them with a variety of weapons. The second simulates zombies in the real world that you can shoot and kill. My game is unique to these as it uses the google cardboard headset to create a more immersive experience. 

The current most popular augmented reality app is Pokemon Go, which is estimated to have been downloaded 750 million times(3 as of 14/11/2017). While the gameplay features are very different to my design it shows the potential for the popularity of AR games. 

Specifics on design 

The main mechanic of this game will be the laser beam. Activating the button will require the physical press of a button. This will activate the laser for a certain amount of time, after this time the laser will deactivate and go on a short cooldown to stop the player from constantly casting the laser.  

The use of the button is important as it helps to build immersion by making the players physical actions cause a reaction within the game space. This is important as building the player's immersion in the app will mean that the player's will have a better overall experience and enjoy their time using the app more. 

The laser will be displayed as a large red light which is fired in the direction the player is facing. The red light will take up a large portion of the screen when fired as this is likely how it is when you actually shoot a red laser from you head area. This will help to build immersion as the laser will act in a way the player's expect and in a way that is realistic. 

List of key requirements: 

The player must be able to shoot a laser beam from their head in the direction they are facing. 

The laser must only last for a certain amount of time after being activated. 

The laser should not be able to be reactivated for a short time after being used. 

The laser should be able to destroy/stop enemies on hit. 

When the laser destroys an enemy the score of the player should be increased. 

There should be enemies which walk toward the player and deal damage to the player when close enough. 

When the player has taken a certain amount of damage the enemies should be removed from the scene and the player's score should be displayed to them. 

The player should be able to see their real-world environment through the app. 

The player should be able to interact with the app through the physical interaction of pressing a button which will activate the laser.
